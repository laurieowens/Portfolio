        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>  I have always loved problem solving and creating through code. Full stack development is a constantly evolving proving ground for those like myself who embrace learning. I believe the totality of life is not one which we can easily control and adaptation is key to success.

          <p>
            I am the mother of two young adults who successfully navigate their own lives now.
            After graduating with a B.S. in Business Administration, I joined a privately held manufacturing company and became the Information Services Manager. Our company produced printing inks for corrugated boxes and newspapers such as "The New York Times". My department created Order Processing and Inventory Control programs for our satellite plants located across the United States and in Venezuela. My responsibilities included the development, implementation, training, maintenance and upgrade of the hardware and software for these systems.
            <p> My husband loved Atlanta and always wanted to return to his home in the South but was unable to because he passed away suddenly.  Four years ago I decided to leave my home in the North and relocate our family to Georgia, thereby honoring his final wish.  I consider it to be one of best decision I have ever made.
            <p> Most recently I worked at a small cafe in Alpharetta, as a Customer Service Representative.  I enjoy the group I work with and getting to know the people who frequent the cafe. Every day presents a new opportunity in some form. </p>
